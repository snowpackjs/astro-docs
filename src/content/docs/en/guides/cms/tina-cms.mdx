[Tina CMS](https://www.tina.io/) is a Git-backed headless content management system.

## Installation 
[Tina Documentation](https://tina.io/docs/introduction/tina-init/)

Depending on your package manager of choice, to install Tina first run `npx @tinacms/cli@latest init` or `pnpx @tinacms/cli@latest init`. After this has finished, you should now have a `.tina` folder in the root of your project and an `admin` folder in your public directory. It will also create a markdown file at `content/posts/hello-world.md`. Feel free to delete this hello world file and it's enclosing folders. 

You will want to change the dev script in package.json to:

```json
// package.json
...
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "pnpm tinacms dev -c 'astro dev'"
}
...
```

**Make sure to replace "pnpm" in the above line with your package manager of choice.**

You will now need to set your collections. This is done in the `.tina/config.ts` file. A config file with a basic posts collection may look something like this:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "tinacms";

// Your hosting provider likely exposes this as an environment variable
const branch = process.env.HEAD || process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF || "main";

export default defineConfig({
  branch,
  clientId: null, // Get this from tina.io
  token: null, // Get this from tina.io
  build: {
    outputFolder: "admin",
    publicFolder: "public",
  },
  media: {
    tina: {
      mediaRoot: "images",
      publicFolder: "public",
    },
  },
  schema: {
    collections: [
      {
        name: "posts",
        label: "Posts",
        path: "src/content/posts",
        format: 'mdx',
        fields: [
          {
            type: "string",
            name: "title",
            label: "Title",
            isTitle: true,
            required: true,
          },
          {
            type: "string",
            name: "description",
            label: "Description",
            required: true,
          },
          {
            type: "string",
            name: "pubDate",
            label: "PubDate",
            required: true,
          },
          {
            type: "boolean",
            name: "draft",
            label: "Draft",
          },
          {
            type: "string",
            name: "body",
            isBody: true,
            label: "Body",
            required: true,    
          }
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

More information on collections can be found in the Tina docs [here](https://tina.io/docs/reference/collections/). If you have set everything up correctly, on running `pnpm run dev` your should now be able to navigate to `localhost:3000/admin/index.html` and see your collections for editing in TinaCMS.

To set up TinaCMS for production, you will either need to use Tina Cloud or self host the Tina Data Layer which can be achieved as a severless function. For more information on this, please see the "Going To Production" section of the Tina docs, starting [here](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/).
