[Decap CMS](https://www.decapcms.org/) (formerly Netlify CMS) is an open-source, Git-based content management system.

Decap adds a route (typically `/admin`) to your project that will load a React app to allow authorized users to manage content directly from the deployed website. Decap will commit changes to your Astro project's source repository.

## Installing DecapCMS

There are two options for adding Decap to Astro:

1. [Install Decap via a package manager](https://decapcms.org/docs/install-decap-cms/#installing-with-npm) with the following command:

	```sh
	npm install decap-cms-app --save
	```
 
1. Import the package into a `<script>` tag in your page `<body>`

	```html title='/admin'
    <body>
      <!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Decap CMS -->
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@^3.1.1/dist/decap-cms.js"></script>
    </body>
	```
 

## Configuration

1. Create a static admin folder at `public/admin/`
2. Add `config.yml` to `public/admin/`: 
  <FileTree>
  - admin
    - index.html
    - config.yml
  </FileTree>
3. Configure your collections schemas in `config.yml`
  ```yml
  collections:
    - name: "blog" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
      label: "Blog" # Used in the UI
      folder: "src/content/blog" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
      create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
      fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
        - { label: "Layout", name: "layout", widget: "hidden", default: "blog" }
        - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }
        - { label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime" }
        - { label: "Featured Image", name: "thumbnail", widget: "image" }
        - { label: "Rating (scale of 1-5)", name: "rating", widget: "number" }
        - { label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown" }
  ```
5. (optional) To enable media uploads to a specific folder via the Decap editor, add an appropriate path:
  ```yml
  media_folder: "src/assets/images" # Location where files will be stored in the repo 
  public_folder: "src/assets/images" # The src attribute for uploaded media
  ```

See the [the Decap CMS configuration documentation](https://decapcms.org/docs/configure-decap-cms/) for full instructions and options.

## Usage
Navigate to `yoursite.com/admin/` to use the Decap CMS editor.

### Common practices

Many users will add their admin route and config file into their project's `public` folder. However it is equally viable to have this route be a `.astro` file in the [Pages](/en/basics/astro-pages/) directory.

## Authentication

### Decap CMS with Netlify Identity

Decap CMS was originally developed by Netlify and has first class support for [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-access-to-sites/identity/). When deploying to netlify, configure Identity for your project via the Netlify dashboard and include the [Netlify Identity Widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget) on the `/admin` route of your project. Optionally include the Identity Widget on the homepage of your site if you plan to invite new users via email.

### Decap CMS with External OAuth Clients

When deploying to hosting providers other than Netlify, you must create your own OAuth routes.

In Astro, this can be done with on-demand rendered routes in your project configured with [`server` or `hybrid` output](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#enable-on-demand-server-rendering) enabled.

See [Decap's OAuth Docs](https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/) for a list of compatible community-maintained OAuth clients.
