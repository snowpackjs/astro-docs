[Decap CMS](https://www.decapcms.org/) (formerly Netlify CMS) is an open-source, Git-based content management system.

Decap adds a route (typically `/admin`) to your project that will load a React app to allow authorized users to manage content directly from the deployed website. Decap will commit changes to your Astro project's source repository.

## Integrating with Astro

There are two options for using Decap with Astro:

1. Loading the default package, either via [unpkg](https://www.unpkg.com) or importing the package into a `<script>` tag.
2. [Manually initializing Decap](https://decapcms.org/docs/manual-initialization/).

### Common practices

Many users will add their admin route and config file into their project's `public` folder. However it is equally viable to have this route be a `.astro` file in the [Pages](/en/basics/astro-pages/) directory.

Decap CMS was originally developed by Netlify so it has first class support for [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-access-to-sites/identity/). When deploying to hosting providers other than Netlify, it is necessary to create your own OAuth routes. These routes are often created as standalone serverless functions for static sites, but it is possible to use Astro's On-demand Rendering to create these routes within your Astro Project.  See [Decap's OAuth Docs](https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/) for more details.
