Astro provides several ways for you to use images on your site, whether they are stored locally inside your project, linked to remotely, or stored in a CMS or CDN!

:::note[`astro:assets` (Experimental - coming in v3.0)]
The experimental `astro:assets` module will be enabled by default in `astro@3.0`.

Follow the [Assets (Experimental) Guide](/en/guides/assets/) to start using Astro's new image solution today!

**Some of the advice below is incompatible with the experimental flag. Please see the Assets page if you are using `astro:assets`.**
:::

### In `.astro` files

Astro uses HTML `<img>` elements to display images, and all HTML image attributes are supported.

The `src` attribute is required, and its format will depend on where your images are stored, and whether you have enabled experimental support for assets:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import rocket from '../images/rocket.svg';
---
<!-- Remote image on another server -->
<img src="https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png" width="25" alt="Astro">

<!-- Local image stored at public/assets/stars.png -->
<img src="/assets/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky.">

<!-- Local image stored at src/images/rocket.svg -->
<img src={rocket} alt="A rocketship in space."/>
```

### In Markdown files

You can use standard Markdown `![]()` syntax or standard HTML `<img>` tags in your `.md` files for images located in your `public/` folder, or remote images on another server.

If you cannot keep your images in `public/`, we recommend enabling [experimental support for assets](/en/guides/assets/), or using the `.mdx` file format, which allows you to combine imported components with Markdown-like syntax. Use the [MDX integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) to add support for MDX to Astro.

```md
<!-- src/pages/post-1.md -->

# My Markdown Page

<!-- Local image stored at public/assets/stars.png -->
![A starry night sky.](/assets/stars.png)
<img src="/assets/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky.">

<!-- Remote image on another server -->
![Astro](https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png)
<img src="https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png" width="25" alt="Astro">
```

### In MDX files

You can use standard Markdown `![]()` syntax or  JSX `<img />` tags in your `.mdx` files to display images from your `public/` folder or remote servers.

Additionally, you can import and use images located in your project's `src/` directory, as you would in Astro components.

```mdx title="src/pages/post-1.mdx"

import rocket from '../images/rocket.svg';

# My MDX Page

// Local image stored at src/images/rocket.svg
<img src={rocket} alt="A rocketship in space."/>

// Local image stored at public/assets/stars.png
![A starry night sky.](/assets/stars.png)
<img src="/assets/stars.png" alt="A starry night sky." />

// Remote image on another server
![Astro](https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png)
<img src="https://docs.astro.build/assets/logomark-light.png" width="25" alt="Astro" />
```

### In UI Framework Components

When adding images in a [UI framework component](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) (e.g React, Svelte), use the image syntax appropriate for that particular component's framework.

## Where to store images

### `src/`

Your images stored in `src/` can be used by components (`.astro`, `.mdx` and other UI frameworks) but not in Markdown files.

We recommend that you keep your images in [`public/`](#public) or store them [remotely](#using-images-from-a-cms-or-cdn) if you must use Markdown files.

Import them from a **relative file path** or [import alias](/en/guides/aliases/) in any component file and then use the import as the image's `src` attribute.


```astro
---
// src/pages/index.astro

// Access images in `src/images/`
import logo from '../images/logo.png';
---
<img src={logo} width="40" alt="Astro" />
```

### `public/`

Your images stored in `public/` can be used by components (`.astro`, `.mdx` and other UI frameworks) and also Markdown files.


However, files in the `/public` directory are always served or copied as-is, with no processing. If you are using images outside of Markdown files, we recommend that local images are kept in `src/` when possible so that Astro can transform, optimize and bundle them.

The `src` attribute is **relative to the public folder**. In Markdown, you can also use the `![]()` notation.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
// Access images in `public/images/`
---
<img src="/images/logo.png" />
```

### `src/assets/` (experimental)

See the [Assets (Experimental)](/en/guides/assets/) guide for enabling experimental use of the `/assets/` folder.

This will require you to update your existing images, remove the current Astro image integration, and will also require additional manual changes to take advantage of some of its new features.

## Astro's Image Integration

:::note[to be deprecated in v3.0]
The [`@astrojs/image`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/image) integration will no longer be actively supported in Astro v3.0. 

We suggest removing it at your earliest convenience and using the experimental `astro:assets` module which will be built in to `astro@3.0`.

Follow the [Assets (Experimental) Guide](/en/guides/assets/) to start using Astro's new image solution today!

**`astro:assets` is not a complete replacement for `@astrojs/image` at this time, but it is under active development.**
:::

For documentation on using `@astrojs/image` in Astro v2, please see the [`@astrojs/image` package documentation](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/main/packages/integrations/image/README.md)

## Using Images from a CMS or CDN

Image CDNs work with Astro. Use an image's full URL as the `src` attribute in an `<img>` tag or Markdown notation.

Alternatively, if the CDN provides a Node.js SDK, you can use that in your project. For example, [Cloudinary’s SDK](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration) can generate the `<img>` tag with the appropriate `src` for you.

## Alt Text

Not all users can see images in the same way, so accessibility is an especially important concern when using images. Use the `alt` attribute to provide [descriptive alt text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/) for images.

This attribute is required for the image integration's `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components. These components will throw an error if no alt text is provided.

If the image is merely decorative (i.e. doesn’t contribute to the understanding of the page), set `alt=""` so that screen readers know to ignore the image.



## Community Integrations

In addition to the official [`@astrojs/image`](/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/) integration, there are several third-party [community image integrations](https://astro.build/integrations?search=images) for optimizing and working with images in your Astro project.
