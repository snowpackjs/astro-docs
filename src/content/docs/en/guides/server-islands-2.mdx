description: Enable more fine-grained control over page load performance with Server islands.

Server islands allow you to on-demand render dynamic or personalized "islands" individually, without sacrificing the performance of the rest of the page.

This means your visitor will see the most important parts of your page sooner, and allows your main content to be more aggressively cached, providing faster performance.

## Server island components

A server island is a normal [Astro component](/en/basics/astro-components/) that is instructed to delay rendering on the page. 

Add the [`server:defer` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#server-directives) to any component on your page to turn it into its own island:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" "server:defer"
---
import Avatar from '../components/Avatar.astro';
---
<Avatar server:defer />
```

These components can do anything you normally would in an on-demand rendered page, such as fetch content, and access cookies:

```astro title="src/components/Avatar.astro"
---
import { getUserAvatar } from '../sessions';
const userSession = Astro.cookies.get('session');
const avatarURL = await getUserAvatar(userSession);
---
<img alt="User avatar" src={avatarURL} />
```

However, a server island component delays rendering until its contents are available without blocking the rest of the page. Your page will be rendered with generic [fallback content for the island](#server-island-fallback-content), while the component's own contents are fetched on the client and displayed when available.

## Server island fallback content

When using the `server:defer` attribute on a component to delay its rendering, you can "slot" in default loading content using the included named `"fallback"` slot.

Your fallback content will be rendered along with the rest of the page initially on page load, and will be replaced with your component's own content when it is available.

This fallback content can be things like:

- A generic avatar instead of the user's own
- Placeholder UI such as custom messages
- Loading indicators such as spinners

To add fallback content, add `slot="fallback"` on a child (other components or HTML elements) passed to your server island component:

```astro
---
import Avatar from '../components/Avatar.astro';
import GenericAvatar from '../components/GenericAvatar.astro';
---
<Avatar server:defer>
  <GenericAvatar slot="fallback" />
</Avatar>
```

## How it works 

Server island implementation happens mostly at build-time where component content is swapped out for a small script.

Each of the islands marked with `server:defer` is split off into its own special route which the script fetches at run time. When Astro builds your site it will omit the component and inject a script in its place, and any content youâ€™ve marked with `slot="fallback"`.

When the page loads in the browser, these components will be requested to a special endpoint that renders them and returns the HTML. This means that users will see the most critical parts of the page instantly. Fallback content will be visible for a short amount of time before the dynamic islands are then loaded.

Each island is loaded independently from the rest. This means a slower island, such as one connected to a legacy backend, won't delay the rest of your personalized content from being available.

This rendering pattern was built to be portable. It does not depend on any server infrastructure so it will work with any host you have, from a Node.js server in a Docker container, to the serverless provider of your choice.

### Accessing the page URL

In most cases you, your server island component can get information about the page rendering it by [passing props](#component-props) like in normal components. 

However, server islands run in their own isolated context outside of the page request. `Astro.url` and `Astro.request.url` in a server island component both return a URL that looks like `/_server-islands/Avatar` instead of the current page's URL in the browser. Additionally, if you are prerendering the page you will not have access to information such as query parameters in order to pass as props.

To access information from the page's URL, you can check the [Referer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header, which will contain the address of the page that is loading the island in the browser:

```astro
---
const referer = Astro.request.headers.get('Referer');
const url = new URL(referer);
const productId = url.searchParams.get('product');
---
```

The main benefit of server islands is getting critical page content to your visitors as soon as possible. Each server island component delays rendering until its contents are available without blocking the rest of the page.
