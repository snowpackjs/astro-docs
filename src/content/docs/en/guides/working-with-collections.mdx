## Querying Collections

Astro provides helper functions to query a collection and return one (or more) content entries.

- [`getCollection()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#getcollection) fetches an entire collection and returns an array of entries.
- [`getEntry()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#getentry) fetches a single entry from a collection.

These return entries with a unique `id`, a `data` object with all defined properties, and will also return a `body` containing the raw, uncompiled body of a Markdown, MDX, or Markdoc document.

```js
import { getCollection, getEntry } from 'astro:content';

// Get all entries from a collection.
// Requires the name of the collection as an argument.
const allBlogPosts = await getCollection('blog');

// Get a single entry from a collection.
// Requires the name of the collection and `id`
const poodleData = await getEntry('dogs', 'poodle');


```

## Using content in Astro templates

After querying your collections, you can access each entry's content directly inside of your Astro component template. For example, you can create a list of links to your blog posts, displaying information from your entry's frontmatter using the `data` property.


```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const posts = await getCollection('blog');
---
<h1>My posts</h1>
<ul>
  {posts.map(post => (
    <li><a href={`/blog/${post.id}`}>{post.data.title}</a></li>
  ))}
</ul>
```
### Rendering body content 

Once queried, you can render Markdown and MDX entries to HTML using the `render()` function property. Calling this function gives you access to rendered HTML content, including both a `<Content />` component and a list of all rendered headings.

```astro title="src/pages/blog/post-1.astro" {5,8}
---
import { getEntry, render } from 'astro:content';

const entry = await getEntry('blog', 'post-1');
const { Content, headings } = await render(entry);
---
<p>Published on: {entry.data.published.toDateString()}</p>
<Content />
```

### Passing content as props

A component can also pass an entire collection entry as a prop.

You can use the [`CollectionEntry`](/en/reference/api-reference/#collection-entry-type) utility to correctly type your components props using TypeScript. This utility takes a string argument that matches the name of your collection schema, and will inherit all of the properties of that collection's schema.

```astro title="src/components/BlogCard.astro" /CollectionEntry(?:<.+>)?/
---
import type { CollectionEntry } from 'astro:content';
interface Props {
  post: CollectionEntry<'blog'>;
}

// `post` will match your 'blog' collection schema type
const { post } = Astro.props;
---
```

## Generating Routes from Content

Content collections are stored outside of the `src/pages/` directory. This means that no pages or routes are generated for your collection items by default.

You will need to manually create a new [dynamic route](/en/guides/routing/#dynamic-routes) if you want to generate HTML pages for each of your collection entries, such as individual blog posts. Your dynamic route will map the incoming request param (e.g. `Astro.params.slug` in `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`) to fetch the correct entry for each page.

The exact method for generating routes will depend on whether your pages are prerendered (default) or rendered on demand by a server.

### Building for static output (default)

If you are building a static website (Astro's default behavior), use the [`getStaticPaths()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#getstaticpaths) function to create multiple pages from a single page component (e.g. `src/pages/[slug]`) during your build.

Call `getCollection()` inside of `getStaticPaths()` to have your collection data available for building static routes. Then, create the individual URL paths using the `id` property of each content entry. Each page is passed the entire collection entry as a prop for [use in your page template](#using-content-in-astro-templates).

```astro title="src/pages/posts/[id].astro" "{ id: post.id }" "{ post }"
---
import { getCollection, render } from 'astro:content';
// 1. Generate a new path for every collection entry
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog');
  return posts.map(post => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
    props: { post },
  }));
}
// 2. For your template, you can get the entry directly from the prop
const { post } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await render(post);
---
<h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
<Content />
```

This will generate a page route for every entry in the `blog` collection. For example, an entry at `src/blog/hello-world.md` will have an `id` of `hello-world`, and therefore its final URL will be `/posts/hello-world/`.

:::note
If your custom slugs contain the `/` character to produce URLs with multiple path segments, you must use a [rest parameter (e.g. `[...slug]`)](/en/guides/routing/#rest-parameters) in the `.astro` filename for this dynamic routing page.
:::

### Building for server output (SSR)

If you are building a dynamic website (using Astro's SSR support), you are not expected to generate any paths ahead of time during the build. Instead, your page should examine the request (using `Astro.request` or `Astro.params`) to find the `id` on-demand, and then fetch it using [`getEntry()`](/en/reference/api-reference/#getentry).


```astro title="src/pages/posts/[id].astro"
---
import { getEntry, render } from "astro:content";
// 1. Get the slug from the incoming server request
const { id } = Astro.params;
if (id === undefined) {
	return Astro.redirect("/404");
}
// 2. Query for the entry directly using the request slug
const post = await getEntry("blog", id);
// 3. Redirect if the entry does not exist
if (post === undefined) {
	return Astro.redirect("/404");
}
// 4. Render the entry to HTML in the template
const { Content } = await render(post);
---
<h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
<Content />
```

Explore the `src/pages/` folder of the [blog tutorial demo code on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/content-layer/src/pages) to see full examples of creating pages from your collections for blog features like a list of blog posts, tags pages, and more!

## Filtering collection queries

`getCollection()` takes an optional "filter" callback that allows you to filter your query based on an entry's `id` or `data` properties.

You can use this to filter by any content criteria you like. For example, you can filter by properties like `draft` to prevent any draft blog posts from publishing to your blog:

```js
// Example: Filter out content entries with `draft: true`
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const publishedBlogEntries = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => {
  return data.draft !== true;
});
```

You can also create draft pages that are available when running the dev server, but not built in production:

```js
// Example: Filter out content entries with `draft: true` only when building for production
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const blogEntries = await getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => {
  return import.meta.env.PROD ? data.draft !== true : true;
});
```

The filter argument also supports filtering by nested directories within a collection. Since the `id` includes the full nested path, you can filter by the start of each `id` to only return items from a specific nested directory:

```js
// Example: Filter entries by sub-directory in the collection
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
const englishDocsEntries = await getCollection('docs', ({ id }) => {
  return id.startsWith('en/');
});
```

## Accessing referenced data

Any [references defined in your schema](/en/guides/defining-collections/#defining-collection-references) must be queried separately after first querying your collection entry. You can use the `getEntry()` function to return a single referenced item, or `getEntries()` to retrieve multiple referenced entries from the returned `data` object. 

```astro title="src/pages/blog/welcome.astro"
---
import { getEntry, getEntries } from 'astro:content';

const blogPost = await getEntry('blog', 'welcome');

// Resolve a singular reference
const author = await getEntry(blogPost.data.author);
// Resolve an array of references
const relatedPosts = await getEntries(blogPost.data.relatedPosts);
---

<h1>{blogPost.data.title}</h1>
<p>Author: {author.data.name}</p>

<!-- ... -->

{relatedPosts.map(post => (
  <a href={post.id}>{post.data.title}</a>
))}
