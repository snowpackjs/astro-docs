## What is a backend as a service?

A backend as a service is a cloud-based system that helps you build and manage your backend infrastructure. It provides a set of tools and services for managing databases, user authentication, and other server-side functionality. This enables you to focus on build your applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Why would I use a backend as a service?

If your project has complex server-side needs, like:
- user signups and authentication
- persistant data storage
- user-uploaded asset storage
- API generation
- realtime communication
You might want to consider a backend as a service.
