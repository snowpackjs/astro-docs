[Clever Cloud](https://clever-cloud.com) is a European cloud platform that provides automated, scalable services. You can deploy your Astro app with Clever Cloud as a static or node application.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed on Clever Cloud in two different ways: as a **Static** application, or as a **Node.js** application, regardless of your `output` mode ([pre-rendered or on-demand](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/)). However, you'll need less configuration when deploying a Node.js application, since it works out-of-the-box with your `package.json`.

### Port and host

Applications on Clever Cloud listen on port **8080**. There are two ways to set your port and your host in Astro:

1. In `package.json` scripts:

    ```json title="package.json" "astro preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080"
     "scripts": {
    "start": "astro dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080",
    "build": "astro build"
    } 
    ```

2. In `astro.config.mjs`:

    ```javascript
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

    export default defineConfig({
        server: {
            port: 8080,
            host: true
        }
    });
    ```


## Deploy Astro from the Console

When deploying on Clever Cloud, follow the application wizard to deploy your astro site. These are the detailed steps:

<Steps>

1. From the lateral menubar, click **Create** > **An application**
2. Choose how to deploy:

    - **Create a brand new app**: to deploy from a local repository with Git
    
    or
    
    - **Select a GitHub repository**: to deploy from GitHub

3. Select a **Node.js** application, or a **Static** one.
	4. Set up the minimal size for your instance and scalability options: Astro can be deployed in a **Nano** instance as minimal size. Instance sizes depends of your application specifications and dependencies. We suggest you start with the smallest instance and then adjust accordingly as you watch the metrics from the **Overview** page.
5. Select a **region** where to deploy your instance.
6. **Add-ons**: Unless you're using a database or Keycloak, you shouldn't need any add-on. See [Further Configuration](#further-configuration) if you do.
7. Inject **environment variables**:

    - For **Node.js**, no specific environment variable is needed to deploy Astro.

    - For a **Static** application, add these variables:

    ```shell
    CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="npm run build"
    CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK="npm install && npm run astro telemetry disable"
    CC_WEBROOT="/dist"
    ````
8. **Deploy!** If you're deploying from **GitHub**, your deployment should start automatically. If you're using **Git**, copy the remote and push on **master** branch. 

</Steps>

:::tip[Other Branches]
Deploy from other branches than `master` branch by using `git push clever <branch>:master`. For example, if you don't want to rename your local `main` branch, use `git push clever main:master`.
