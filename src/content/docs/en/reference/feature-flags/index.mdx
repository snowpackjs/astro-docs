Some features are available only after enabling a flag in the Astro configuration file.


```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    legacy: {
        // enable legacy flags
        // for backwards compatibility
    },
    experimental: {
        // enable experimental flags
        // to try out new features
    },
});
```

## Legacy Flags

To help some users migrate between versions of Astro, we occasionally introduce `legacy` flags.

These flags allow you to opt in to some deprecated or otherwise outdated behavior of Astro
in the latest version, so that you can continue to upgrade and take advantage of new Astro releases until you are able to fully update your project code.

## Experimental Flags

Astro offers experimental flags to give users early access to new features for early testing and feedback.

These flags allow you to help guide feature development by reporting issues and sharing your opinions. These features are not guaranteed to be stable and may include breaking changes even in small `patch` releases while the feature is actively developed.

We recommend updating Astro frequently and keeping up with release notes in the the changelog which will inform you of any changes needed to your project code. The feature flag documentation will always be updated for the current released version only.
