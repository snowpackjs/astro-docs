The [Astro Studio web portal](http://studio.astro.build) allows you to connect to and manage your remote hosted [Astro DB databases](/en/guides/astro-db/) through a web interface or using [CLI commands](/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-studio-cli).

From your Studio dashboard, you have access to account management, help articles and a support message console.

Visit [Astro Studio](http://studio.astro.build) to sign up or log in.

## Deploy with a Studio connection

You can deploy your Astro DB project with a live connection to your Studio database. This is possible with any deployment platform using static builds or an [SSR adapter](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/).

First, configure your build command to connect with Studio using the `--remote` flag. This example applies the flag to a `"build"` script in your project's `package.json`. If your deployment platform accepts a build command, ensure this is set to `npm run build`.

```json title="package.json" "--remote"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "astro build --remote"
  }
}
```

### Create a Studio app token

You need to create an app token to access your Studio database from a production deploy. You can create an app token from your Studio project dashboard by navigating to the **Settings** tab and selecting **Tokens**. 

Copy the generated token and apply as an environment variable / environment secret in your deployment platform using the name `ASTRO_STUDIO_APP_TOKEN`. 

## Set up the GitHub CI Action

You can automatically push schema changes to your Studio database with the Studio CI action. This verifies changes can be made safely, and keeps your configuration up-to-date whenever you merge to `main`.

[Follow GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) to configure a new secret in your repository with the name `ASTRO_STUDIO_APP_TOKEN` and your Studio app token as the value for the secret.

Once your secret is configured, create a new GitHub Actions workflow file in your project's `.github/workflows` directory to checkout the repository and install Node.js as steps, and use the `withastro/action-studio` action to sync schema changes. 

The action will run `astro db verify` on all [event triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) to ensure schema changes can be applied safely. If you add the **[push](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push)** trigger specifically, the action will push those changes to your Studio database.

This example GitHub Action `_studio.yml` pushes changes whenever the `main` branch is updated:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/_studio.yml"
name: Astro Studio

env:
  ASTRO_STUDIO_APP_TOKEN: ${{secrets.ASTRO_STUDIO_APP_TOKEN }}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

jobs:
  DB:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      actions: read
      pull-requests: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - uses: jaid/action-npm-install@v1.2.1
      - uses: withastro/action-studio@main
```
