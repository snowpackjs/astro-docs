[Bun](<https://bun.sh/>) is a newer runtime for JavaScript built for speed. See [Bun's documentation](<https://bun.sh/docs>) for more information.

Using Bun with Astro still is experimental, not all integrations might work as expected. If you find any issues, please open an issue!

## Installing Bun

Installing Bun is a breeze - just run one simple command in your terminal and you're ready to go! Plus, with support for `npx packages, creating a new Astro project with Bun is as easy as pie.

Here's how you can install Bun:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Create a new Astro project with Bun

Bun has support for `npx` packages, which means you can create a new Astro project with Bun in one familiar command:

```bash
bunx create-astro@latest my-astro-project-using-bun
```

:::tip[Tip]
If you want to use a theme, that will work as well!
```bash
bunx create-astro@latest my-astro-project-using-bun --template eliancodes/brutal
```
:::

## Install your dependencies

If you're starting a new project using `bunx create-astro`, you can skip this step, the CLI will automatically use Bun to install dependencies. Otherwise, you'll need to install your dependencies with Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running the development server

Running the development server with Bun should feel quite familiar:

```bash
bun run dev
```

:::note[Note]
Keep in mind that using `bun dev` will not work, as that will start Bun's internal dev server and not your Astro development server.
:::

## Using Astro integrations

But the best part? Bun makes it simple to integrate with all of your favorite Astro tools. With support for npx packages, you can use any of the Astro integrations with Bun in one familiar command:

```bash
bunx astro add react
```

This will work exactly the same as if you were using NPM, but with the added benefit of using Bun's blazing fast runtime.

:::note[Note]
1. Some integrations might not work as expected. If you find any issues, please open an issue!
2. Keep in mind that using `bun add` will not work, as that will add the package to Bun's dependencies and not your Astro project.

## Building your site with Bun

And when it's time to build and serve your site, Bun has got you covered with just a few easy commands.

```bash
bun run build
```

This will output your site to the `dist/` directory, just like it would do with NPM.

Then, you can serve your site the `preview` command:

```bash
bun preview
```

That's all there is to it!
