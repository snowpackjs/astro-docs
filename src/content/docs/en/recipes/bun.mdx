[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a runtime for JavaScript built for speed. See [Bun's documentation](https://bun.sh/docs) for more information.

Using Bun with Astro is now officially supported but is still very new. Some integrations may not work as expected. 

Consult [Bun's official documentation for working with Astro](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/astro) for details.
