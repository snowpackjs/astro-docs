[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a runtime for JavaScript built for speed. See [Bun's documentation](https://bun.sh/docs) for more information.

Using Bun with Astro now officially supported but is still very new. Some integrations may not work as expected. Consult [Bun's official documentation for working with Astro](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/astro) for details. Our community is busy at work preparing our own guide for using Bun in Astro! 

If you have any problems using Bun, please [open an Issue on GitHub with Bun directly](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/new/choose)!
