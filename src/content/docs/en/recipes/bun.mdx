[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a runtime for JavaScript built for speed.

Bun recently made their first stable release. However, using Bun with Astro may reveal rough edges. Some integrations may not work as expected. Consult [Bun's official documentation for working with Astro](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/astro) for details. 

If you have any problems using Bun, please [open an Issue on GitHub with Bun directly](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/new/choose).
