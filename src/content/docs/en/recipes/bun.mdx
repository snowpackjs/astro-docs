[Bun](<https://bun.sh/>) is a newer runtime for JavaScript built for speed. See [Bun's documentation](<https://bun.sh/docs>) for more information.

## Installing Bun

Installing Bun is as easy as running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Create a new Astro project with Bun

Bun has support for `npx` packages, which means you can create a new Astro project with Bun in one familiar command:

```bash
bunx create-astro@latest my-astro-project-using-bun
```

{/* :::tip[Tip]
If you want to use a theme, that will work as well!
```bash
bunx create-astro@latest --template @eliancodes/brutal my-astro-project-using-bun 
```
::: */}

## Install your dependencies

If you're starting a new project using `bunx create-astro`, you can skip this step, the CLI will automatically use Bun to install dependencies. Otherwise, you'll need to install your dependencies with Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

## Running the development server

Running the development server with Bun, should feel quite familiar:

```bash
bun run dev
```

:::note[Note]
Keep in mind that using `bun dev` will not work, as that will start Bun's internal devserver and not your Astro development server.
:::

## Using Astro integrations

Bun has support for `npx` packages, which means you can use any of the Astro integrations with Bun in one familiar command:

```bash
bunx astro add react
```

## Building your site with Bun

Building your site with Bun is done with the following command:

```bash
bun run build
```

This will output your site to the `dist/` directory, just like it would do with NPM.

Then, you can serve your site the `preview` command:

```bash
bun run preview
```

That's all there is to it!
