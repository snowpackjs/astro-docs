When building an Astro website with [islands architecture / partial hydration](/en/core-concepts/partial-hydration/), you may have run into this problem: **I want to share state between my components.**

"Typical" UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte may encourage ["context" providers](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for other components to consume. But when [partially hydrating components](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components) within Astro or Markdown, you cannot use these context wrappers ðŸ˜³

We'll need a different solution to create shared stores your components can read and write from: [**nanostores**](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores).

## Why nanostores?

The [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) library allows you to author stores that any component can interact with. We recommend nanostores because:
- **They're lightweight.** Nanostores ship the bare minimum JS you'll need (less than 1 KB) with zero dependencies.
- **They're framework-agnostic.** This means sharing state between Preact, Svelte, and Vue should be seemless! Astro is built on flexibility, so we love solutions that offer a similar developer experience no matter your preference.

Still, there are a number of alternatives you can explore. These might include:
- [React Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
- [Svelte's built-in stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores)
- [Sending custom browser events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events) between components

<summary>**ðŸ™‹ How do Svelte stores compare to nanostores?**</summary>

**Nanostores and [Svelte stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores) are very similar!** In fact, [nanostores allow you to use the same `$` shortcut](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#svelte) for subscriptions that you might use with Svelte stores.

If you want to avoid third party libraries, [Svelte stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores) are a great cross-island communication tool on their own. Still, you might prefer nanostores if a) you like their add-ons for ["objects"](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#maps) and [async state](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#lazy-stores), or b) you want to communicate between Svelte and other UI frameworks like Preact or Vue.
