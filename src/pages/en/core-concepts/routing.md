Astro uses **file-based routing** to generate your build URLs based on the file layout of your project `src/pages` directory. When a file is added to the `src/pages` directory of your project, it is automatically available as a route based on its filename.

## Static routes

Astro Components (`.astro`) and Markdown Files (`.md`) in the `src/pages` directory become pages on your website. Each page’s route is decided based on its filename and path within the `src/pages` directory. This means that there is no separate "routing config" to maintain in an Astro project.

```bash
# Example: Static routes
src/pages/index.astro        -> mysite.com/
src/pages/about.astro        -> mysite.com/about
src/pages/about/index.astro  -> mysite.com/about
src/pages/about/me.astro     -> mysite.com/about/me
src/pages/posts/1.md         -> mysite.com/posts/1
```

## Dynamic routes

Sometimes, you need to generate many URLs from a single page component. Astro uses file-based routing to support **dynamic route parameters** in the filename, so that one page can match many dynamic routes based on some pattern.

An important thing to keep in mind: Astro is a static site builder. There is no Astro server to run in production, which means that every page must be built ahead of time. Pages that use dynamic routes must export a `getStaticPaths()` function which will tell Astro exactly what pages to generate. Learn more by viewing the complete [API Reference](/en/reference/api-reference#getstaticpaths).

### Named parameters

Dynamic parameters are encoded into the filename using `[bracket]` notation:

- `pages/blog/[slug].astro` → `/blog/:slug` (`/blog/hello-world`, `/blog/post-2`, etc.)
- `pages/[username]/settings.astro` → (`/fred/settings`, `/drew/settings`, etc.)
- `pages/[lang]-[version]/info.astro` → (`/en-v1/info`, `/fr-v2/info`, etc.)

#### Example: Named parameters

Consider the following page `pages/post/[pid].astro`:

```astro
---
// Example: src/pages/post/[pid].astro
const {pid} = Astro.request.params;
---
<p>Post: {pid}</p>
```

Any route like `/post/1`, `/post/abc`, etc. will be matched by `pages/post/[pid].astro`. The matched path parameter will be passed to the page component at `Astro.request.params`.

For example, the route `/post/abc` will have the following `Astro.request.params` object available:

```json
{ "pid": "abc" }
```

Multiple dynamic route segments can be combined to work the same way. The page `pages/post/[pid]/[comment].astro` will match the route `/post/abc/a-comment` and its `query` object will be:

```json
{ "pid": "abc", "comment": "a-comment" }
```

### Rest parameters

If you need more flexibility in your URL routing, you can use a rest parameter as a universal catch-all. You do this by adding three dots (`...`) inside your brackets. For example:

- `pages/post/[...slug].astro` → (`/post/a`, `/post/a/b`, `/post/a/b/c`, etc.)

Matched parameters will be sent as a query parameter (`slug` in the example) to the page. In the example above, the path `/post/a/b/c` will have the following `query` object:

```json
{ "slug": "a/b/c" }
```

You can use names other than `slug`, such as: `[...param]` or `[...name]`.

Rest parameters are optional by default, so `pages/post/[...slug].astro` could match `/post/` as well.

#### Example: Rest parameters

For a real-world example, you might implement GitHub’s file viewer like so:

```
/[org]/[repo]/tree/[branch]/[...file]
```

In this example, a request for `/withastro/astro/tree/main/docs/public/favicon.svg` would result in the following parameters being available to the page:

```js
{
	org: 'withastro',
	repo: 'astro',
	branch: 'main',
	file: 'docs/public/favicon.svg'
}
```

## Excluding pages

You can exclude pages, or even whole directories from being built by prefixing their names with an underscore (`_`).

This allows you to create private pages, and also to co-locate tests, utilities, and components with their related pages, preventing them from being built into html files and placed into the `dist/` directory.

In this example, only `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/post1.md` will be built as page routes and html files.

```
src/
└── pages/
   ├── index.astro
   ├── posts/
   │   ├── post1.md
   │   ├── _SomeComponent.astro
   │   └── _utils.js
   ├── _hidden-directory/
   |   ├── page1.md
   |   └── page2.md
   └── _hidden-page.astro
```

## Caveats

- Static routes without path params will take precedence over all other routes, and named path params over catch all path params. Take a look at the following examples:
  - `pages/post/create.astro` - Will match `/post/create`
  - `pages/post/[pid].astro` - Will match `/post/1`, `/post/abc`, etc. But not `/post/create`
  - `pages/post/[...slug].astro` - Will match `/post/1/2`, `/post/a/b/c`, etc. But not `/post/create`, `/post/abc`
