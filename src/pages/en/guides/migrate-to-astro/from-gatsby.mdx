[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a static-site web builder based on React.

## Key Similarities

Gatsby and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- [Astro's JSX-like syntax](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#the-component-template) should feel familiar if you are used to writing React.

- Astro has built-in support for Markdown and an [integration for using MDX files](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/). Both Gatsby and Astro use [Remark](https://remark.js.org/) by default for Markdown manipulation and pre-processing, so you can continue to use many of your existing Remark plugins.

- Astro has an [official integrations for using React component](/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/). Note that in Astro, React files **must** have a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension.

- Astro supports [installing NPM packages](/en/guides/imports/#npm-packages), including several for React. You may be able to keep some or all of your existing React components and dependencies.

- Astro projects can also be SSG or [SSR](/en/guides/server-side-rendering/). (Support for per-page rendering strategy is planned.)

## Key Differences

When you rebuild your Gatsby site in Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- [MPA vs SPA](/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/): Gatsby is a React-based single-page application (SPA). Astro sites are multi-page apps built using [`.astro` components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/), but can also support [React, Preact, Vue.js, Svelte, SolidJS, AlpineJS, Lit](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) and raw HTML templating.

- [Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) are not written as exported functions that return page templating. Instead, you'll split your code into a "code fence" and a body exclusively for the HTML you generate.

- [Local file data](/en/guides/imports/): Gatsby uses GraphQL to retrieve data from your project files. Astro uses ESM imports and the [`Astro.glob()`](/en/guides/imports/#astroglob) helper to import data from your project files. GraphQL may be optionally added to your Astro project, but is not included by default.

## Switch from Gatsby to Astro

To convert a Gatsby blog to Astro, start with our official blog theme starter template, or explore more community blog themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes/). 

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates).

  <PackageManagerTabs>
    <Fragment slot="npm">
    ```shell
    npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm create astro@latest --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn create astro --template blog
    ```
    </Fragment>
  </PackageManagerTabs>

Bring your existing Markdown (or MDX, with our optional integration) files as content to [create Markdown or MDX pages](/en/guides/markdown-content/).

While file-based routing and layout components are similar in Astro, you may wish to read about [Astro's project structure](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/) to learn where files should be located. For example, you will need to rename your Gatsby static assets folder from `static/` to `public/`.

To convert other types of sites, such as a portfolio or documentation site, see more official starter templates on [astro.new](https://astro.new). You'll find a link to each project's GitHub repository, as well as one-click links to open a working project in StackBlitz, CodeSandbox and Gitpod online development environments.
