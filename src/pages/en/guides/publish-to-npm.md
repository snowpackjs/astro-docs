Building a new Astro component? **Publish it to [npm!](https://npmjs.com/)**

Publishing a component is a great way to reuse work across your team, your company, or the entire world. Astro components can be published to and installed from npm, just like any other JavaScript package.

**Astro’s ability to publish and reuse popular components is one of it’s most powerful features!**

Even if you don't plan on publishing your components online, the patterns outlined below can help any developer design reusable components in isolation from their custom website or business logic.

## Creating a package

> Before diving in, it will help have a basic understanding of:
>
> - [Node Modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules)
> - [JSON Manifest (`package.json`)](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file)
> - [Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#workspaces)

To create a new package, we recommend developing with **workspaces**. This will allow you to develop your component alongside a working copy of Astro.

```
my-project/
   ├─ demo/
      └─ ... for testing and demonstration
   ├─ package.json
   └─ packages/
      └─ my-component/
         ├─ index.js
         ├─ package.json
         └─ ... additional files used by the package
```

In this example, named `my-project`, we create a project with a single package, named `my-component`, and a `demo` directory for testing and demonstrating the component.

This is configured in the project root’s `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "workspaces": ["demo", "packages/*"]
}
```

In this example, multiple packages can be developed together from the `packages` directory. These packages can also be referenced from `demo`, where you can install a working copy of Astro.

```shell
npm init astro demo --template minimal
```

Now let’s explore the files that will make up your individual package:

### `package.json`

The `package.json` in the package directory includes all of the information related to your package, including its description, dependencies, and any other package metadata.

```json
{
  "name": "my-component",
  "description": "... description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js",
    "./astro": "./MyAstroComponent.astro",
    "./react": "./MyReactComponent.jsx"
  },
  "files": ["index.js", "MyAstroComponent.astro", "MyReactComponent.jsx"],
  "keywords": ["astro-component", "... etc", "... etc"]
}
```

#### `package.json#description`

The short description of your component used to help others know what it does.

```json
{
  "description": "An Astro Element Generator"
}
```

#### `package.json#type`

The module format used by Node.js and Astro to interpret your `index.js` files.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

We recommend using `"type": "module"` so that your `index.js` can be used as an entrypoint with `import` and `export`.

### `package.json#homepage`

The url to the project homepage. 

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme"
}
```

This is a great way to direct users to an online demo, documentation, or homepage for your project.

#### `package.json#exports`

The entry points allowed by Astro to import your component or any of its [files](#packagejsonfiles).

```json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./index.js",
    "./astro": "./MyAstroComponent.astro",
    "./react": "./MyReactComponent.jsx"
  }
}
```

In this example, importing `my-component` would use `index.js`, while importing `my-component/astro` or `my-component/react` would use `MyAstroComponent.astro` or `MyReactComponent.jsx`.

#### `package.json#files`

```json
{
  "files": ["index.js", "MyAstroComponent.astro", "MyReactComponent.jsx"]
}
```

#### `package.json#keywords`

An array of keywords relevant to your component that are used to help others [find your component on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:astro-component) and any other search catalogs.

We recommend adding the `astro-component` as a special keyword to maximize its discoverability in the Astro ecosystem.

```json
{
  "keywords": ["astro-component", "... etc", "... etc"]
}
```

> Keywords are also used by our [integrations library](https://astro.build/integrations)! [See below](#integrations-library) for a full list of keywords we look for in NPM.

---

### `index.js`

The main **package entrypoint** used whenever your package is imported.

```js
export { default as MyAstroComponent } from './MyAstroComponent.astro';

export { default as MyReactComponent } from './MyReactComponent.jsx';
```

This allows you to package multiple components together into a single interface.

#### Example: Using Named Imports

```astro
---
import { MyAstroComponent } from 'my-component';
import { MyReactComponent } from 'my-component';
---
<MyAstroComponent />
<MyReactComponent />
```

#### Example: Using Namespace Imports

```astro
---
import * as Example from 'example-astro-component';
---
<Example.MyAstroComponent />
<Example.MyReactComponent />
```

#### Example: Using Individual Imports

```astro
---
import MyAstroComponent from 'example-astro-component/astro';
import MyReactComponent from 'example-astro-component/react';
---
<MyAstroComponent />
<MyReactComponent />
```

---

## Developing your package

Astro does not have a dedicated "package mode" for development. Instead, you should use a demo project to develop and test your package inside of your project. This can be a private website only used for development, or a public demo/documentation website for your package.

If you are extracting components from an existing project, you can even continue to use that project to develop your now-extracted components.

## Testing your component

Astro does not currently ship a test runner. This is something that we would like to tackle before our v1.0 release. _(If you are interested in helping out, [join us on Discord!](https://astro.build/chat))_

In the meantime, our current recommendation for testing is:

1. Add a test `fixtures` directory to your `demo/src/pages` directory.
2. Add a new page for every test that you'd like to run.
3. Each page should include some different component usage that you'd like to test.
4. Run `astro build` to build your fixtures, then compare the output of the `dist/__fixtures__/` directory to what you expected.

```bash
my-project/demo/src/pages/__fixtures__/
  ├─ test-name-01.astro
  ├─ test-name-02.astro
  └─ test-name-03.astro
```

## Publishing your component

Once you have your package ready, you can publish it to npm!

To publish a package to npm, use the `npm publish` command. If that fails, make sure that you've logged in via `npm login` and that your package.json is correct. If it succeeds, you're done!

Notice that there was no `build` step for Astro packages. Any file type that Astro supports can be published directly without a build step, because we know that Astro already supports them natively. This includes all files with extensions like `.astro`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, and `.css`.

If you need some other file type that isn't natively supported by Astro, you are welcome to add a build step to your package. This advanced exercise is left up to you.

## Integrations Library

Share your hard work by adding your integration to our [integrations library](https://astro.build/integrations)!

### `package.json` data

The library is automatically updated nightly, pulling in every package published to NPM with the `astro-component` keyword.

The integrations library reads the `name`, `description`, `repository`, and `homepage` data from your `package.json`.

Avatars are a great way to highlight your brand in the library! Avatars aren't supported by the NPM registry unfortunately, once your package is published you can [file an issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) with the avatar attached.

> Need to override the information our library reads from NPM? No problem! [File an issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/issues/new/choose) with the updated information and we'll make sure the custom `name`, `description`, or `homepage` is used instead.

### Collections

In addition to the required `astro-component` keyword, special keywords are also used to automatically organize packages. Including any of the keywords below will add your integration to the collection in our integrations library.

| collection  | keywords                                 |
|------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| All         | `astro-component`                        |
| Analytics   | `analytics`                              |
| CMS         | `cms`, `database`                        |
| CSS + UI    | `css`, `ui`, `icon`, `icons`, `renderer` |
| E-commerce  | `ecommerce`, `e-commerce`                |
| Performance | `performance`, `perf`                    |
| SEO         | `seo`, `performance`, `perf`             |
