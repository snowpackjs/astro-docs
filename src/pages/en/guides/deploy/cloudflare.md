You can deploy your Astro project on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) a platform for frontend developers to collaborate and deploy static (JAMstack) and SSR websites.

## Prerequisites

To get started you will need:

- A Cloudflare account. If you donâ€™t already have one, you can create a free Cloudflare account during the process.
- Your app code pushed to a [GitHub](https://github.com/) or a [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) repository.

## How to deploy a static site

1. Set up a new project on Cloudflare Pages.

2. Use the following build settings:

    - **Framework preset**: `Astro`
    - **Build command:** `npm run build`
    - **Build output directory:** `dist`
    - **Environment variables (advanced)**: Currently, Cloudflare Pages supports `NODE_VERSION = 12.18.0` in the Pages build environment by default. Astro requires `14.15.0`, `v16.0.0`, or higher. You can add an environment variable with the **Variable name** of `NODE_VERSION` and a **Value** of a [Node version thatâ€™s compatible with Astro](/en/install/auto/#prerequisites) or by specifying the node version of your project in a `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` file.

3. Click the **Save and Deploy** button.

## How to deploy an SSR site

You can also deploy an Astro SSR site to Cloudflare Pages using the [`@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/cloudflare#readme).
