You can deploy an Astro site using [SST](https://sst.dev), an open-source framework for deploying applications to AWS. This is the easiest way to get a fully serverless Astro deployment on AWS with SSR support.

You can also use any additional SST constructs like Cron Jobs, Buckets, Queues, etc while maintaining typesafety.

## Quickstart

1. Create an astro project
1. Run `npx create-sst@rc`
1. It should detect that you are using Astro and ask you to confirm.
1. Once you're ready for deployment you can run `npx sst deploy --stage=production`

If you wish to use any [additional SST constructs](https://docs.sst.dev/) you can add them to the `sst.config.ts`. Then take a look [Resource Binding](https://docs.sst.dev/resource-binding) to understand how to use them in your Astro code.

Or if you prefer a walkthrough you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFP3ZHxO7Gg).
