You can deploy an Astro site using [SST](https://sst.dev), an open-source framework for deploying fully serverless applications to AWS with SSG and SSR support.

You can also use any additional SST constructs like Cron Jobs, Buckets, Queues, etc while maintaining type-safety.

## Quickstart

1. Create an astro project
1. Run `npx create-sst@rc`
1. It should detect that you are using Astro and ask you to confirm.
1. Once you're ready for deployment you can run `npx sst deploy --stage=production`

To use any [additional SST constructs](https://docs.sst.dev/), add them to `sst.config.ts`. 

```js
// config example here might be nice?
```

Consult the [SST docs on Resource Binding](https://docs.sst.dev/resource-binding) to understand how to use them in your Astro code.

Or if you prefer a walkthrough you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFP3ZHxO7Gg).

If you have any questions [ask in the SST discord](https://discord.gg/sst).
