Astro is a perfect choice for your content-focused site: blogs, marketing sites, portfolios, and more!

Astro helps you author and present your content. You can write a blog post directly in Astro using Markdown/MDX, or fetch your content from a headless CMS. Astro lets you build a site around your content: you can add a layout to your pages, create an index of posts, and set up an RSS feed to allow readers to subscribe.

## Writing Content

In Astro, you can author your content in a variety of ways. 
- In Markdown (`.md`) files, designed to make it easy to write rich text content 
- In MDX (`.mdx`) files, which let you include components and dynamic expressions in your document
- Using a third-party content management system (CMS), then pulling that content into a `.astro` page.


### Markdown Authoring
Markdown is a convenient syntax for writing rich text with basic formatting and common elements like headers, lists, and images.

Create a new `.md` file within the `src/pages/` directory in your Astro repository, or bring in an existing markdown file. You can edit this directly in your code editor or use an external markdown editor. Some online Markdown editors like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) or [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) will even sync your work with your Astro repository stored on GitHub.

### MDX Authoring
If you add the MDX integration to your project, you can use `.mdx` files, which let you include JavaScript expressions and custom components within your Markdown content. This includes both static [Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) and interactive [framework components](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/). Add UI elements such as a banner or an interactive carousel right in your text to turn your content into full-fledged web pages.

Write `.mdx` files directly in your code editor, alongside your project files. You write text content in standard markdown, but have access to additional features that utilize JavaScript.

### Headless CMS Authoring

Write blog posts in your existing Content Management System (CMS) such as Storyblok, WordPress, or Contentful. Some CMSes, like Storyblok, provide an official [Astro integration](https://www.storyblok.com/mp/announcing-storyblok-astro). Others expose a JavaScript SDK that Astro pages can use to [fetch your remote content](/en/guides/data-fetching/#fetch-from-a-headless-cms).

## Managing pages

Markdown and MDX files live in your `src/pages` directory and make use of [file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/). Files in this directory will generate pages on your site, built at a URL corresponding to the post's file path. You can also [fetch filenames and metadata](/en/reference/api-reference/#astroglob) from your Markdown and MDX frontmatter, allowing you to build index pages or tag pages.

If you're writing your content in a CMS, you can fetch your posts and use [dynamic routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes) to use one `.astro` file to generate a route for each post. In Astro's default static mode, these routes are generated at build time. If you opt-in to [SSR mode](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/), you respond to a request at runtime and fetch the content on demand.
