Now that you have some blog posts, let's use Astro's API to work with your files!

## Where are we now?

Click to run a working version of the code at this point in the tutorial right on this page.

 Check your code against the tutorial example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are we going?

<Goals>

  - fetched from your local files to create your list of blog posts
  - created dynamically-generated `tag` pages
  - added an RSS feed for your blog at `rss.xml`

</Goals>

Astro's API gives you access to some handy, pre-made functions you can use to collect data from your existing files to build common blog features like a blog archive, and individual pages for each blog tag. 

Astro also has a package for creating an RSS feed so that users can subscribe to your new posts in a feed reader. 

You'll see these functions and helpers in this unit: 
- `Astro.glob()` which allows you to access data from your local files
- `getStaticPaths()` which allows you to create multiple pages (routes) at once
- `rss()`, which uses both of these functions to create a feed for your blog.
