Now that you have some blog posts, let's use Astro's API to add some typical blog features!

<Goals>
  - listed of all your blog posts on your Blog page
  - created dynamically-generated `tag` pages
  - added an RSS feed for your blog at `rss.xml`
</Goals>

Astro's API gives you access to some handy, pre-made functions you can use for common blog features like making a list of all your posts, creating individual pages for each blog post tag, as well as a package for creating an RSS feed so that users can subscribe to your new posts in a feed reader. 

You'll see these functions and helpers in this unit: 
- `Astro.glob()` which allows you to access multiple files of your site at the same time
- `getStaticPaths()` which allows you to create multiple pages (routes) on your site from one single file
- `rss()`, which uses these to create your blog's feed.
