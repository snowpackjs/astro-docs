## Source Control

Many software projects use `git`, a version control system to track changes in a project over time. 

In this tutorial, you will use a free **online git provider** and will not need to know how to use git commands in the terminal. All git actions in this tutorial will be performed through menu items in your code editor and will sync your **repository** (files and version history) to the cloud. 

:::tip[we'll use...]
This tutorial will use **GitHub** for online source control, but you are welcome to use your preferred online git provider.
:::

1. Create a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

    Make a note of your username. You will view your account, and any projects you create at `https://github.com/username`

## Continuous Build and Deployment
Once your project is stored online, you will connect your repository to a free **web host** to build and deploy your site live on the web every time you commit a change to your code. 

:::tip[we'll use...]
This tutorial will use **Netlify**, but you are welcome to use your preferred hosting service for deploying your site to the internet.
:::

1. Create a free account at [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

    Make a note of your username. You will view your dashboard and any sites you create at `https://app.netlify.com/teams/username`
