## Background Knowledge 

This tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with **HTML**, **Markdown**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**. But, you will be able to learn everything you need to know by following the tutorial instructions.

## Development Tools Needed

## Create your online accounts

To complete this tutorial in a web browser, you will need three online accounts that will work together to store, develop, and publish your site to the web. You can use other online services, but this tutorial will provide instructions for working with GitHub, StackBlitz and Netlify.


### 1. Storing your Project: GitHub

Many software projects use `git`, a version control system to track changes in a project over time. In this tutorial, you will use **GitHub.com**, a free online git provider and will not need to know how to use git commands in the terminal. All git actions in this tutorial will be performed through StackBlitz menu items and will sync your **repository** (files and version history) to the cloud.

1. Create a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

    Make a note of your username. You will view your account, and any projects you create at `https://github.com/<username>`
    
### 2. Developing your site: Stackblitz

1. Sign in to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) using your GitHub credentials. This site will provide you with two different software tools that you will need to build your site:
 - a **code editor** (an alternative to locally-installed software like VSCode) where you will edit your files.
 - a **terminal pane** for running server commands.


### 3. Publishing your site: Netlify

Once your project is stored online, you will connect your GitHub repository to a free **web host** to build and deploy your site live on the web every time you commit a change to your code. This tutorial will use **Netlify**, but you are welcome to use your preferred hosting service for deploying your site to the internet.

1. Create a free account at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) (or your preferred hosting service).

    Make a note of your username. You will view your dashboard and any sites you create at `https://app.netlify.com/teams/username`

### Terminal

You will use a **command line (terminal)** to create your Astro project and to run key commands to build, develop, and test your site.

You can access the command line through a local terminal program for your operating system. Common applications include **Terminal** (MacOS/Linux), **Command Prompt** (Windows), and **Termux** (Android). One of these will probably already be on your machine. 

You will also need to have **Node.js** installed. To check to see whether you already have a compatible version (v.14.18.0, or v16.12.0 or higher) installed: 

1. Launch your terminal and type the following into the command line:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

2. If necessary, follow the instructions to [install Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via the command line.

:::tip[we'll use...]
While you are editing your project, this tutorial will only use the terminal built in to your code editor.
:::

### Code Editor

Additionally, you will need to download and install a **code editor** to write your code. 

:::tip[we'll use...]
This tutorial will use **VS Code**, but you can use any editor for your operating system.
:::

1. [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) or another code editor of your choice. 


### Source Control

Many software projects use `git`, a version control system to track changes in a project over time. 

In this tutorial, you will use a free **online git provider** and will not need to know how to use git commands in the terminal. All git actions in this tutorial will be performed through menu items in your code editor and will sync your **repository** (files and version history) to the cloud. 

:::tip[we'll use...]
This tutorial will use **GitHub** for online source control, but you are welcome to use your preferred online git provider.
:::

1. Create a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

    Make a note of your username. You will view your account, and any projects you create at `https://github.com/username`

### Continuous Build and Deployment
Once your project is stored online, you will connect your repository to a free **web host** to build and deploy your site live on the web every time you commit a change to your code. 

:::tip[we'll use...]
This tutorial will use **Netlify**, but you are welcome to use your preferred hosting service for deploying your site to the internet.

1. Create a free account at [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
