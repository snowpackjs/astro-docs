  - run the `create astro` setup wizard to create a new Astro project
  - start the Astro server in development (dev) mode
  - view a live preview of your website in your browser
  - make your first edit to your new website
</PreCheck>

:::tip[using stackblitz]
Instead of using the setup wizard, you will open a new project in your browser. Your project will automatically run in development mode and display a website preview.

**Follow the steps below, then skip all the way down to ["Edit Your Page"](#edit-your-page)**: 
1. Visit [stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Visit [astro.new](https://astro.new) and click the button to open the "Empty Project" template in StackBlitz. (This will launch in StackBlitz.)
3. In the upper left of the StackBlitz editor window, click to "fork" the template (save to your own account dashboard).
4. Wait for the project to load, and you will see a live preview of the "Empty Project" starter.

## Run the `create astro` setup wizard

The preferred way to create a new Astro site is through our `create astro` setup wizard.

1. In the command line of your terminal, run the following command using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with npm
  npm create astro@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with pnpm
  pnpm create astro@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with yarn
  yarn create astro
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

2. Confirm `y` to install `create-astro`
3. When the prompt asks, "Where would you like to create your new project?" type in the name of a folder to create a new directory for your project, e.g.
`./tutorial`

    :::note
    A new Astro project can only be created in a completely empty folder, so choose a name for your folder that does not already exist!
    :::

3. You will see a short list of starter templates to choose from. Use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate to the "Empty Project" template, and then press return (enter) to submit your choice. 

4. When the prompt asks, "Would you like to install dependencies?" type `y`.

5. When the prompt asks, "Would you like to initialize a new git repository?" type `y`.

6. When the prompt asks you to choose a TypeScript option, select "Relaxed."

When the install wizard is complete, you no longer need this terminal. You can now open VS Code to continue.

## Prepare your Code Editor

### Open your Project Folder in VS Code

When you start VS Code, you will be prompted to open a folder. Choose the folder that you created during the setup wizard.

### Install the Astro language extension
You should see a pop-up notification asking you if you would like to install recommended extensions. Click to see the recommended extensions, and choose the offical Astro support for Visual Studio Code.  (You can always add this later.)

### Make the terminal visible
You can now use the terminal built right into this window, instead of your computer's Terminal program.

This pane might be hidden (minimized) by default. You can make it visible through the navigation menu items under <kbd>View</kbd> > <kbd>Terminal</kbd> or by dragging up from the bottom of your screen.

You should see the command prompt indicating that you are in your project folder, such as:

```sh
user@machine:~/tutorial$
```

## Run Astro

In order to preview your project files _as a website_ while you work, you will need Astro to be running in development (dev) mode.

### Start the dev server

1. Run the command to start the Astro dev server by typing into VS Code's terminal:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Now you should see confirmation in the terminal that Astro is running in dev mode. ðŸš€

## View a preview of your website

Your project files contain all the code necessary to display an Astro website, but the browser is responsible for displaying your code as web pages.

1. Click on the `localhost` link in your terminal window (or open a new tab in your internet browser and type in the address) to see a live preview of your new Astro website! Astro uses `https://localhost:3000` by default if port 3000 is available.


## Edit your page

Here's what the Astro "Empty Project" starter website should look like in the browser preview:

![A blank white page with the word Astro at the top.](/tutorial/minimal.png)

1. In VS Code, navigate in the Explorer file pane to `src/pages/index.astro` and click on it to open the file's contents in an editable tab.

    The contents of your `index.astro` file should look like this:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
    ---
    ---

    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type ="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.ico" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content = {Astro.generator} >
        <title>Astro</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Astro</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Edit the content of your page `<body>`.

Type in the editor to change the the heading text on your page and save the change.

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" del={2} ins={3}
    <body>
      <h1>Astro</h1>
      <h1>My Astro Site</h1>
    </body>
    ```

3. Check the browser preview and you should see your page content updated to the new text.

That's it! Now you are ready to make and see changes to your code and build your Astro website.

:::note[customize your view]
Your code editor has many screen sections available to you all at once. You may want to resize these panes to make the terminal smaller (you won't use it often while running in dev mode) or to minimize your list of files to give you the most area for your code.
:::

## Using the Astro dev server

While the Astro server is running in dev mode, you will NOT be able to run commands in your terminal window. Instead, this pane will give you feedback as you preview your site.

You can stop the dev server at any time and return to the command prompt by typing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes the dev server will stop on its own while you are working. If your live preview stops working, go back to the terminal and restart the dev server by typing `npm run dev`.
