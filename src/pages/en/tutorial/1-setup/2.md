## Get the dev tools you need

Want to complete this tutorial in an online code editor instead? There's no local development environment to set up!

<details>
<summary>
Follow these instructions and then skip ahead to [Create your first Astro project](/en/tutorial/1-setup/2/)!
</summary>
1. Sign in to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) using your GitHub credentials. This site will provide you with two different software tools that you will need to build your site:
 - a **code editor** (an alternative to locally-installed software like VSCode) where you will edit your files.
 - a **terminal pane** for running server commands.
</details>
:::

### Terminal

You will use a **command line (terminal)** to create your Astro project and to run key commands to build, develop, and test your site.

You can access the command line through a local terminal program for your operating system. Common applications include **Terminal** (MacOS/Linux), **Command Prompt** (Windows), and **Termux** (Android). One of these will probably already be on your machine. 

For Astro to run on your system, you will also need to have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. To check to see whether you already have a compatible version (v.14.18.0, or v16.12.0 or higher) installed: 

1. Launch your terminal and type the following into the command line:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

2. If necessary, follow the instructions to [install Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) via the command line.

### Code Editor

Additionally, you will need to download and install a **code editor** to write your code. 

:::tip[we'll use...]
This tutorial will use **VS Code**, but you can use any editor for your operating system.
:::

1. [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) or another code editor of your choice.
