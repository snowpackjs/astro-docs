<PreCheck>
  - Add your GitHub repository as a new Netlify app
  - Deploy your Astro site to the web
</PreCheck>

Here, you will connect your GitHub repository to Netlify. Netlify will use that project to create a live, public website. 

## Create a new Netlify site

1. Log in to https://app.netlify.com/.

2. Click <kbd>Add new site</kbd> > <kbd>Import an existing project</kbd>.

    You will be asked to connect to a Git provider. Choose GitHub and follow the steps onscreen to authenticate your GitHub account. Then, choose your Astro project's GitHub repository from the list provided.

3. At the final step, Netlify will show you your app's site settings. The defaults should be correct for your Astro project, so you can scroll down and click <kbd>Deploy site</kbd>.

Congratulations, you have an Astro website!

## Change your project name

On your site's overview page in Netlify, you will see your randomly-generated project name, and your website URL of the form `https://project-name-123456.netlify.app`. You can change your project name to something more memorable, and this will automatically update your URL.

## Visit your new website

Click on the URL in your site settings, or type it in to a browser window to view your new website.

### Test your knowledge

You want to update the home page of your website. Number the following steps in the correct order to explain how this happens:

|| &nbsp &nbsp 4 &nbsp &nbsp || Netlify will respond to any changes on GitHub, and will automatically re-build my website from the most recent version of my repository. Then, Netlify will deploy the updated version of my website at my URL.

|| &nbsp &nbsp 2 &nbsp &nbsp || I make changes to `index.astro` using my code editor and check the browser preview to make sure I can see the changes.

|| &nbsp &nbsp 1 &nbsp &nbsp || I open my project folder in my code editor and run Astro in dev mode to see a live preview of my changes.

|| &nbsp &nbsp 3 &nbsp &nbsp || I commit and push my changes to my repository stored on GitHub.
