  - make your first edit to your new website
</PreCheck>

## Edit your page

1. In your code editor, navigate in the Explorer file pane to `src/pages/index.astro` and click on it to open the file's contents in an editable tab.

    The contents of your `index.astro` file should look like this:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
    ---
    ---

    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type ="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.ico" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content = {Astro.generator} >
        <title>Astro</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Astro</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Edit the content of your page `<body>`.

Type in the editor to change the the heading text on your page and save the change.

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" del={2} ins={3}
    <body>
      <h1>Astro</h1>
      <h1>My Astro Site</h1>
    </body>
    ```

3. Check the browser preview and you should see your page content updated to the new text.

Congratulations! You are now an Astro developer!

Even though you're excited to keep coding, before we go too far, the rest of this unit will set you up for success with version control and a published website you can show off.

If you really can't wait, you can skip ahead to [Unit 2](/en/tutorial/2-pages/) and keep coding.

## Before you go
### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="usage">

- [ ] I edited the content of `index.astro` and can see my updated Astro website in the browser at `localhost:3000`.

- [ ] I am an Astro developer!

- [ ] I am going to take Astro's advice and set up my online repository and deploy my site now, while my project is still simple and not much can go wrong... or I will skip ahead knowing I've been warned!

</Checklist>
