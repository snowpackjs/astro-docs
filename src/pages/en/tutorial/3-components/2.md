</PreCheck>

Now that you have used Astro components on a page, let's use a component within another component!

## Create a Footer Component

1. Create a new file at the location `src/components/Footer.astro`.

2. Copy the following code into your new file, `Footer.astro`.

    ```astro title="src/components/Footer.astro"
    ---
    const platform = "github"
    const username = "withastro"
    ---
    <p>Learn more about my projects on <a href={`https://www.${platform}.com/${username}`}>{platform}</a>!</p>
    ```

### Import and Use Footer.astro

1. Add the following import statement anywhere in the frontmatter in each of your three Astro pages (`index.astro`, `about.astro`, and `blog.astro`):

    ```astro title="src/components/Footer.astro" ins={2}
    ---
    import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
    ---
    ```

2. Add a new `<Footer />` component in your Astro template on each page, just before the closing `</body>` tag to display your footer at the bottom of the page. 

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={1}
       <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. In your browser preview, check that you can see your new footer text on each page.

## Try it yourself - Personalize your footer

Customize your footer to display multiple social networks (e.g. Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn) and include your username to link directly to your own profile.

### Code Check-In
If you've been following along with each step in the tutorial, your `index.astro` file should look like this:

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
const pageTitle = "Home Page"
import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import '../styles/global.css'
---

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>{pageTitle}</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="/">Home</a>
		<a href="/about/">About</a>
    <Navigation />
		<h1>{pageTitle}</h1>
		<Footer />
	</body>
</html>
```

## Create a Social Media component

1. Create a new file at the location `src/components/Social.astro`.

2. Copy the following code into your new file, `Social.astro`.

    ```astro title="src/components/Social.astro"
    ---
    const {platform, username} = Astro.props
    ---
    <span><a href={`https://www.${platform}.com/${username}`}>{platform}</a></span>
    ```

### Import and use `Social.astro` in your Footer

1. Change the code in `src/components/Footer.astro` to import, then use this new component three times, passing different **component attributes** as props each time:

    ```astro title="src/components/Footer.astro" del={2,3,6} ins={4,7-9}
    ---
    const platform = "github"
    const username = "withastro"
    import Social from './Social.astro';
    ---
    <p>Learn more about my projects on <a href={`https://www.${platform}.com/${username}`}>{platform}</a>!</p>
    <Social platform="twitter" username="astrodotbuild" />
    <Social platform="github" username="withastro" />
    <Social platform="youtube" username="astrodotbuild" />
    ```

2. Check your browser preview, and you should see your new footer displaying links to these three platforms on each page.

## Style your Social Media Component

1. Add the following `<style>` tag to `src/components/Social.astro` and corresponding `class` to the `<span>` element:

    ```astro title="src/components/social.astro" ins={6-17} 'class="social-platform'
    ---
    const {platform, username} = Astro.props
    ---
    <span class="social-platform"><a href={`https://www.${platform}.com/${username}`}>{platform}</a></span>

    <style>
      .social-platform {
        margin: 0.4em;
        padding: 1em;
        background-color: #ff9776;
        border-radius: 3px;
      }
      a {
        color: #00539F;
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    </style>
    ```

2. Add the following HTML element with a corresponding `<style>` tag to `src/components/footer.astro` to separate your footer from the rest of the page content. 

    ```astro title="src/components/footer.astro" ins={4-8,10}
    ---
    import Social from './Social.astro'
    ---
    <style>
       .spacer {
           height: 2em;
       }
    </style>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <Social platform="twitter" username="astrodotbuild" />
    <Social platform="github" username="withastro" />
    <Social platform="youtube" username="astrodotbuild" />
    ```

3. Check your browser preview again and confirm that each page shows an updated footer.

### Analyze the pattern

1. What line of code do you need to write in an Astro component to **receive values** of `title`, `author`, and`date` **as props**?

    || `const { title, author, date } = Astro.props` ||
    

2. How do you **send values as props** to an Astro component?

    || Write **component attributes** `<BlogPost title="My First Post" author="Dan" date="12 Aug 2022" />` ||
</Box>

<Box icon="question-mark">

### Analyze the Pattern

1. How is your `<Footer />` component similar to your `<Navigation />` component? How is it different?

    || Both are Astro components, and both are written in the component template to provide some HTML that is defined elsewhere. The `<Footer />` component is itself further composed of more components. ||

2. Your website's footer and navigation each display three links. List three differences between these two sets of links. Think about things like _where the link text comes from_, _the styling of the links on the page_ and _how the link's URL is determined_.

    || The website footer contains link text that is generated by another component; the navigation component has static link text that is typed in directly. ||

    || The website footer links are styled by a `<style>` tag in the social component; the navigation component links only have default and global styling applied. ||

    || The website footer links are generated dynamically using props passed as component attributes to another component; the navigation component uses static link URLs that are typed in directly. ||

3. Describe how Astro uses **component-based design** to render a page and why this is useful.

    || Astro can render components within other components (**component-based design**) which allows you to compose HTML in independent, reusable pieces. This can make it easier to make changes to your code, making updates in only one place. It can help you troubleshoot as you work, by identifying more precisely where to look to find the code that creates a specific part of your page. ||

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="props">
- [ ] I can create new `.astro` components in `src/components/`
- [ ] I can import and use Astro components inside other Astro components.
- [ ] I can send data (pass props) as component attributes to an Astro component so that it can use these values to dynamically generate HTML.
</Checklist>
