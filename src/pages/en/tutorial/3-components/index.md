Now that you have `.astro` and `.md` files generating entire pages on your website, let's make and reuse smaller bits of HTML with Astro components!

## Where are we now?

 Check your code against the tutorial example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are we going?

In this unit, you'll learn how to create **Astro components** to reuse code for common elements across your website. 

You'll build:
- a Navigation component that presents a menu of links to your pages 
- a Footer component to include on the bottom of each page
- a Social Media component, used in the Footer, that links to profile pages
- an interactive Hamburger component to toggle the Navigation on mobile

Along the way, you'll use CSS and JavaScript to build a responsive design that reacts to screen sizes and user input.
