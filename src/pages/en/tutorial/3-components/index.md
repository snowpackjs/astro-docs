Now that you have `.astro` and `.md` files generating entire pages on your website, let's make and reuse smaller bits of HTML with Astro components!

## Where are we now?

Click to run a working version of the code at this point in the tutorial right on this page.

 Check your code against the tutorial example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are we going?

<Goals>
  - created reusable Astro components for UI items on your website (e.g. Header, Footer)
  - written standard HTML elements alongside Astro components
  - sent data from one Astro component to another passing `props` as a component attribute

</Goals>

The building blocks of an Astro site are **components**: `.astro` files that generate static HTML. 

An Astro component can generate the all the HTML needed for an entire web page, like your existing `index.astro`, `about.astro`, and `blog.astro` files. Or, they can produce smaller units of HTML like a footer or a button.

**Component-based design** is the practice of building your project as a collection of modular, often reusable, pieces. Astro components are meant to be building-blocks that can fit within, and alongside other components.
