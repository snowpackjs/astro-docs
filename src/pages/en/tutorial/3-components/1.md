Now that you have the same HTML written in multiple pages of your Astro site, let's replace that duplicated content with a reusable Astro component!

<Goals>
  - [Create a new folder for components](#create-a-new-srccomponents-folder)
  - [Build an Astro component to display your navigation links](#create-a-navigation-component)
  - [Replace existing HTML with a new, reusable navigation component](#import-and-use-navigationastro)

</Goals>

## Create a new `src/components/` folder

To hold `.astro` files that will generate HTML but that will not become new pages on your website, you will need a new folder in your project:`src/components/`. 


## Create a Navigation component

1. Create a new file: `src/components/Navigation.astro`.

2. Copy your links to navigate between pages from the top of any page and paste it into your new file, `Navigation.astro`:

    ```astro title="src/components/Navigation.astro" "---"
    ---
    ---
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about/">About</a>
    <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>
    ```
    :::tip
    If there is nothing in the frontmatter of your `.astro` file, you don't have to write the code fences. You can always add them back in when you need them.
    :::

### Import and use Navigation.astro

1. Go back to `index.astro` and import your new component inside the code fence:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
    ---
    import Navigation from '../components/Navigation.astro';
    ---
    ```

2. Then below, replace the existing navigation HTML link elements with the new navigation component you just imported:

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" del={1-3} ins={4}
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about/">About</a>
    <a href="/blog/">Blog</a>
    <Navigation />
    ```

3. Check the preview in your browser and notice that it should look exactly the same... and that's what you want! 

Your site contains the same HTML as it did before. But now, those three lines of code are provided by your `<Navigation />` component. 

### Try it Yourself!
Import and use the `<Navigation />` component in the other two pages on your site (`about.astro` and `blog.astro`) using the same method.

Don't forget to
- add an import statement at the top of the component script, inside the code fence.

- replace the existing code with the navigation component.

:::note
When you restructure your code but do not change the way your page looks in the browser, you are **refactoring**. You will **refactor** several times in this unit as you replace parts of your page HTML with components. 

This allows you to get started quickly with any working code, often duplicated throughout your project. Then, you can improve your existing code's design incrementally without changing the outward appearance of your site.

## Before you go

### Test your knowledge

Fill in the blanks with **reusable**, **`src/pages`**,**refactor** and **standard HTML elements**:

`.astro` files can use || **standard HTML elements** || and other Astro components in the same template, alongside each other. This means that you can decide when and where to || **refactor** || your code, creating || **reusable** || fragments of HTML defined in an Astro component. 

These components should live in a folder outside of || **`src/pages`** || since they are not meant to be pages on your website.

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="navigation">
- [ ] I can replace content that is duplicated on multiple pages by creating a single new component and including it on each page.
- [ ] I can add content to a page by creating a new component, importing it and including it in the page template where I want it to appear.
</Checklist>
