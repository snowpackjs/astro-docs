## Project: Build a blog

In this tutorial, you'll learn Astro's key features by building a fully-functioning blog, from zero to full launch! ðŸš€

Along the way, you'll: 
- set up your development environment 
- create and edit pages and blog posts for your website
- build with Astro components
- query and work with local files
- add interactivity to your site 

Click to run a working version of the finished project:

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/astro-tutorial-completed?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/pages/index.astro"></iframe>

The finished blog will be **deployed to the web**, and can even be used as a personal website once you have completed this tutorial.

:::note
If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit https://astro.new and choose a starter template to open and edit in a in an online editor.
