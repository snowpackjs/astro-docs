## Project: Build a blog

The blog that you will build has many of the features you would expect in a developer blog: a Home page, an About page, and a Blog Index page linking to individual blog posts written in Markdown. You will add a responsive navigation menu, a light/dark theme toggle, individual pages for your blog tags and an RSS feed for your site. The finished blog will be deployed to the web, and can even be used as a personal website once you have completed this tutorial!


:::note
If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit https://astro.new and choose a starter template to open and edit in a in an online editor.

## About this tutorial

### Where to start

This tutorial is designed to accommmodate all levels of web development experience. 

[Unit 0](/en/tutorial/0-introduction/2/) will help you make sure you have the development tools and online accounts you'll need to build and deploy your blog to the web.

[Unit 1](/en/tutorial/1-setup/) will walk you through creating a new Astro project, storing it on GitHub and deploying to Netlify.

Feel free to skip ahead to [Unit 2](/en/tutorial/2-astro-pages/) if you can create a new Astro project using `create astro` in the terminal or from the [minimal starter template](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/minimal) and deploy it on the web independently, and are ready to jump right into the code.

### How to navigate

Use the sidebar on the right to view the tutorial units. Each unit is divided into pages, and clicking on a page will take you there.

### Tracking your progress

At the end of each section, there is a checklist for moving on so you can be reminded of the knowledge and skills covered on each page. If you choose to complete these checklists, your progress will be visible in the tutorial navigation sidebar. (This is only set in your browser's local storage, and is not available elsewhere. No data is sent to, nor stored by Astro.) 

### Additional Learning

In addition to the steps to complete your project, there are opportunities to test your knowlege along the way and links to further resources. These are not required, but may help solidify some of the core Astro concepts.
