Now that you have an About page with content about you, let's style it!

## Styling an Individual Page

Using Astro's own `<style></style>` tags, you can style items on your page. Adding **attributes** and **directives** to these tags gives you even more ways to style.

1. Copy the following code and paste it into `src/pages/about.astro` immediately after the code fence, before the `<html>` tag:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
   
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
    </style>
    ```

    Check all three pages in your browser preview. Which color is the page title of:

    - your Home page?  || _black_ ||
    - your About page? || _purple_ ||
    - your Blog page? || _black_ ||

    :::tip
    If you are unable to determine colors visually, you can use the dev tools in your browser to inspect the `<h1>` title elements and verify the text color applied.
    :::

2. Add the following code to your existing style tag:

     ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" ins={5-8}
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: green;
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Update the list of skills on your About page by adding the class name `skill` to the generated `<li>` element. Your code should now look like this:

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" 'class="skill"'
    <p>My skills are:<p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    ```

  4. Visit your About page in your browser again, and verify, through visual inspection or through dev tools, that each item in your list of skills is now green and bold.

## CSS Variables
The Astro `<style>` tag can also reference any variables from your frontmatter script using the `define:vars={...}` directive. You can **define variables within your code fence**, then **use them as CSS variables in your style tag**.

1. Add the following code into the frontmatter script of `src/pages/about.astro`

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    ---
    const skillColor = "green"
    ---
    ```

2. Update your existing `<style>` tag below to first define, then use this `skillColor` variable.

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro" "define:vars={{skillColor}}" "var(--skillColor)" del={6} ins={7}
    <style define:vars={{skillColor}}>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: green;
        color: var(--skillColor);
        font-weight: bold;
      }
    </style>
    ```

3. Check your About page in your browser preview, and and once again, you should not notice any changes! The color green is still being applied, but now through the `define:vars` directive.

## âœ¨ðŸ§© Try it Yourself! ðŸ§©âœ¨
 
 1. Update the `<style>` tag on your About page so that it matches the one below. 

    ```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
    <style define:vars={{skillColor, fontWeight, textCase, bulletStyle}}>
      h1 {
        color: purple;
      }
      .skill {
        color: var(--skillColor);
        font-weight: var(--fontWeight);
        text-transform: var(--textCase);
      }
      ul li::marker {
        content: var(--bulletStyle);
      }
    </style>
    ```
 
 2. Add any missing variable definitions in your frontmatter script so that your new `<style>` tag successfully applies these styles to your list of skills:
    - the text color is green
    - the text is bold
    - the list items are in all-caps (all uppercase letters)
    - the list bullets are asterisks (*)

<summary>âœ… Show me the code! âœ…</summary>

```astro title="src/pages/about.astro"
---
const skillColor = "green"
const fontWeight = "bold"
const textCase = "uppercase"
const bulletStyle = "'*'"
---
```
</details>
