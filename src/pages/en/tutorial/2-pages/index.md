Now that you have a working site on the web, let's add pages and posts!

## Where are we now?

Click to run a working version of the code at this point in the tutorial right on this page.

 Check your code against the tutorial example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.


## Where are we going?

In this unit, you'll
- create your first Astro pages with the `.astro` syntax
- add blog posts with Markdown (`.md`) files
- style an individual page with `<style>` 
- apply global styles across pages

 Along the way, you'll learn how the **two sections of a `.astro` file**  work together to create a page, and how to use variables and conditional rendering on your pages.
