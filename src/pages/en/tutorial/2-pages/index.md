Now that you have a working site on the web, let's add pages and posts!

<Goals>
  - created new Astro pages (About, Blog)
  - added three blogs post in Markdown
  - styled your About page using Astro's `<style>` tags
</Goals>

 In this Module, you will learn about the **two sections of a `.astro` file** and how they work together to create the content for a page on your website. You'll also add blog posts written as Markdown (`.md`) files. Want to make a new page? You'll add a new `.astro` or `.md` file to your project.

### Anatomy of an Astro file
```astro title="src/pages/a-typical-astro-file.astro"

// Astro Script (frontmatter) 
// Written in JavaScript/TypeScript
// used for imports, variables, functionsâ€¦
---
<!-- Astro Template (body) -->  
<!-- Written in Astro (HTML with additional JSX-like features) -->
<!-- contains HTML elements, components, JX/JSX espressions -->
```
