Let's see how an Astro island can fetch data in response to user actions!

<PreCheck>

  - create a second Preact component
  - use `client:only="preact"` to skip server HTML rendering 
  
</PreCheck>

## Preact Quote Generator

This component is written in Preact using popular hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()`. 

It fetches a random quotation from an external API both on page refresh, and also in response to a button click. It needs to be rendered entirely on the client to work properly.

1. Copy the code below and paste it into a new file named `Quote.jsx` in `src/components`:

    ```jsx title="src/components/Quote.jsx"
    import { h } from 'preact';
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'preact/hooks';

    export default function Quotable() {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);

      async function updateQuote() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.quotable.io/random");
        const data = await response.json();
        setData(data);
      }

      useEffect(() => {
        updateQuote();
      }, []);

      if (!data) return null;

      return (
        <div>
          <figure>
            <blockquote>{data.content}</blockquote>
            <figcaption>â€” {data.author}</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <button onClick={updateQuote}>New Quote</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

2. Import and add this component to your Home page at `index.astro`.

    ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={4,11}
    ---
    import BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
    import Greeting from '../components/Greeting.jsx';
    import Quote from '../components/Quote.jsx';
    const pageTitle="Home Page"
    ---
    <BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
      <h2>My awesome blog subtitle</h2>
      <Greeting messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hola"]} />
      <Greeting client: load messages={["Hi", "Hello", "Howdy", "Hola"]} />
      <Quote client:only="preact" />
    </BaseLayout>
    ```

3. Check your browser preview at `localhost:3000` and verify that your component automatically fetches a random quotation on page load, and in response to clicking the <kbd>New Quote</kbd> button.

4. Preview your built site, following [the instructions on the previous page](/en/tutorial/6-islands/1/#build-your-site). You can commit your changes to GitHub and wait for Netlify to automatically build and republish your site to the web, or you can stop the dev server, build, then preview your build locally.

5. Refresh the page several times and click the <kbd>New Quote</kbd> button and verify that both events fetch a new random quotation from the API.

### Checklist for moving on

<Checklist key="framework">
- [ ] I can install an Astro integration using the command `astro add` in the terminal.
- [ ] I can write UI framework components in their own language, with their own native extention, then import and use them in `.astro` components alongside my Astro components.
- [ ] I can choose whether to use a `client:directive` to control hydration on my UI framework component, depending on when I want its JavaScript to run.
</Checklist>
